===========

> Plain webpack 4 boilerplate with Babel, SASS, lodash, Bootstrap v4, jQuery, Popper.js on board!

## Requirements
You only need <b>node.js</b> pre-installed and you’re good to go. 

If you don’t want to work with lodash, just remove it from the node packages and the webpack config.

## Ready to go with 4 easy steps!

## Step 01: Download
Clone into current directory
```sh
git clone <this repo link> 
```

## Step 02: Setup
Install all dependencies
```sh
$ npm install
```

## Step 03: Development
Run the local webpack-dev-server with livereload and autocompile on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
```sh
$ npm run dev
```
## Step 04: Build
Build the current application
```sh
$ npm run build
```

## [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
If you're not familiar with webpack, the [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) will serve the static files in your build folder and watch your source files for changes.
When changes are made the bundle will be recompiled. This modified bundle is served from memory at the relative path specified in publicPath.
